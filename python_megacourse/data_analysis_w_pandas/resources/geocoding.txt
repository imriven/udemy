addresses have a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates. Every point on earth has these coordinates.
The process to convert addresses to coordinates is called geocoding
converting latitude and longitude into an address is call reverse geocoding
Geopy is a library, import to use
From geopy we want to use geocoders. Geocoders needs and internet connection to work it will get the address and then send you the cooridinates.
A none working address will show none.
Geocode will only take the address as "Street, City, State, Zip" 
So we have to reconstruct it to include a column that has the information presented this way.
