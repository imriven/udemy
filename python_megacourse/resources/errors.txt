fixing errors

an error is a bug that causes the program to function incorrectly

python two types of errors

syntax errors
exceptions

------------------------------------------------
Syntax errors -  an error with the way the script is composed

for example:

a = [1, 2, 3]
print a

you would get a syntax error in python3 because print is a function and needs () like print()

once error is fixed

print(a)

the script will work

-------------------------------------------------------

Exceptions - if error is not a syntax error it is an exception
python will check for syntax errors before exceptions

type error -  a type of exception. 

a = 1
b = "2"
print(a + b)

this will cause a type error since you can not add an integer to a string


name error - use of a variable name that hasn't been defined

a = 1
b = 2
print(c)

python doesn't know what c is and will throw a name error

indentation error - inconsistency in the code where there are tabs and spaces used to indent - Mixing of using tabs and spaces

traceback - code that you're running (stack) has an error and the traceback will go through your code to find where the error happens.
