json is another module that needs to be imported

we import it by typing in the shell

import json
data = jason.load(open("path to the file.json"))

----------------------

example -

type(data)
will return:
<class 'dict'>

------ 

after file is loaded you can print it to the console
above we gave the file a variable of data

print(data)

the file will print to the console

-----------------

you can access a word in the file like this

data["word"]

--------------------------
