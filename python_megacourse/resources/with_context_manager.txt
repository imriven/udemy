Before this is how we opened files

myfile = open("example.txt, "w")
(this creates new file in folder)
myfile = write("Something")
(this puts the word something into the example txt file)
9
(the value of the string is returned after writing to the file.)
myfile.close()
(we save and close this file)


a quicker way of writing this is by writing it this way 

with open("example.txt", "w") as myfile:
        myfile.write("Something")
        (press enter twice)

dont have to close file this way
theres less code this way
