Creating and writing a txt file in ide

1. Make sure you are in the correct directory you want to create the new file in.

2. open the ide by typing python

3. type in :

>>> myfile = open("yourfilename.txt", "w")
* note if you do not type in w you won't be able to write in the file you will just open it. The open method takes two arguments


4. to write in file type:

>>> myfile.write("yourString")
*note every new line needs /n for a line break or it will concatonate for each line you add in. you add in a line by typeing in :

>>> myfile.write("what you want to write")
>>> myfile.write("what you want to write")
>>> myfile.write("what you want to write")

5. to save:

>>> myfile.close()
*note if you reopen file this way it will automatically overwrite old file. To add text to an existing file you want to append it

6. to append file type in:

>>> myfile = open("yourfilename.txt", "a")

7. use write method again:

myfile.write("yourString")
*remember to use \n for a line break

8. to append or add text to end of file 

>>> myfile = open("yourfilename.txt", "+a")

cursor starts at the end of file and will add text to the end.

if you want to see what's in file before adding anything type:

myfile.seek(0)
myfile.read()

and what is in the file should show up

you can use myfile.write("text you want to write")
to append whatever to the end
